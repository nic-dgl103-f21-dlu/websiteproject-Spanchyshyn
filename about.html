          My name is Max Panchyshyn, and I graduated from the top of my class at Discover Community College in 2017 for their Bookkeeping and Administration course. Since then I have accumulated years of experience working with Sage50 Simply Accounting, and have become a certified ProAdvisor for Quickbooks Online.

    I view my clients as an important extension of my own business, and believe that success comes best from cooperation and understanding. To this end I will always take the time to educate my clients on any accounting subject that they need assistance with, and will adjust my methods to the particular needs of themselves and their business.
